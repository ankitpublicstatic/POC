I’ve gone through your logs carefully 👍
**Good news first:** there is **NO ERROR here**. Your application has **started successfully**.

Let me break this down clearly and also point out what is *not* happening (which is probably what you’re worried about).

---

## ✅ What is WORKING (confirmed)

### 1️⃣ Application started successfully

```text
Tomcat started on port(s): 9097 (http)
Context refreshed
```

✔ Spring Boot is UP
✔ Embedded Tomcat is running
✔ Port **9097** is listening

---

### 2️⃣ Spring Security configuration is OK

Logs like:

```text
Will secure Ant [pattern='/api/v1/customer/login'] with []
```

This means:

* Spring Security filter chains are created
* These endpoints are **permitted (no auth required)**

✔ This is **normal & expected**
✔ Not an error
✔ Happens during startup

---

### 3️⃣ Quartz Scheduler started

```text
Scheduler quartzScheduler_$_NON_CLUSTERED started.
```

✔ Quartz jobs are running
✔ Schedulers executed successfully

---

### 4️⃣ Database is working

```text
Hibernate: select ... from estore_db.order_info
```

✔ MySQL connection OK
✔ Hibernate queries executed
✔ No transaction errors

---

## ⚠️ What are those WARNINGS?

### Swagger / Springfox warnings

```text
OperationImplicitParameterReader : Coercing to be of type string
```

### Meaning

* This is a **Springfox (Swagger 2)** issue
* Happens when:

  * `@RequestParam Object`
  * `@PathVariable Object`
  * Complex DTOs without explicit schema

✔ Harmless
✔ Happens in many production apps
✔ Does NOT affect APIs

### Optional fix (not mandatory)

If you want to reduce noise:

```java
@ApiParam(type = "string")
```

or migrate to **springdoc-openapi** later.

---

## ❗ What is MISSING (important)

### 🚨 There is **NO Elasticsearch startup log**

You should normally see something like:

```text
ElasticsearchRestTemplate initialized
Connected to Elasticsearch at http://localhost:9200
```

But your logs show **nothing related to Elasticsearch**.

---

## 🔍 Why Elasticsearch is not showing up

One (or more) of these is true:

### 1️⃣ Elasticsearch container is NOT running

Check:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see something like:

```text
elasticsearch   9200->9200
```

If not running → Spring silently skips ES.

---

### 2️⃣ Spring Data Elasticsearch auto-config is disabled

If you have:

```yaml
spring:
  data:
    elasticsearch:
      repositories:
        enabled: true
```

✔ OK

But **if `create: false` is set**, Spring will **not create index**, but it should still connect.

---

### 3️⃣ Index already exists with incompatible mapping

If index exists with wrong mapping, Spring **won’t log loudly**.

Check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/products
```

---

## ✅ What you SHOULD do next (step-by-step)

### 1️⃣ Verify Elasticsearch is running

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "cluster_name": "...",
  "version": { ... }
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Check index existence

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
```

---

### 3️⃣ Manually create index (recommended since create=false)

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @products-index.json
```

---

### 4️⃣ Enable Elasticsearch logs (TEMP)

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.data.elasticsearch: DEBUG
    org.elasticsearch.client: DEBUG
```

Restart → you’ll see ES connection logs.

---

## 🧠 Summary (very important)

✔ Your app **started perfectly**
✔ Security config is OK
✔ DB + Scheduler working
⚠ Swagger warnings are harmless
❗ Elasticsearch is **not visible in logs** → check container & index

---

If you want, next I can:

* Validate your **Elasticsearch Docker setup**
* Check **Spring Boot ↔ ES version compatibility**
* Fix **Search_As_You_Type mapping**
* Debug why repository queries aren’t hitting ES

Just tell me what you want next 🚀
