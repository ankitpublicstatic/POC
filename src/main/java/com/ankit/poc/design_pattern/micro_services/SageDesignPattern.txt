Two Types of Saga Patterns
1️⃣ Choreography Saga (Event-driven) ✅ Saga using Events (Event-based Saga) ✅ (Preferred)
Characteristics:-
No central coordinator
Each service reacts to events

Loose coupling
Choreography-based
Services react to facts

Example:-   OrderPlaced → PaymentService listens
			PaymentCompleted → Inventory listens

2️⃣ Orchestration Saga (Command-driven) Saga using Messages (Command-based Saga)
Characteristics:-
Direct commands
Tighter coupling
Orchestrator usually present
Central saga orchestrator
Sends commands

Example:- OrderService → PaymentService
              "ChargePayment"



Saga is typically implemented using event-driven choreography, where services publish domain events after local transactions. Message-based orchestration is also possible but leads to tighter coupling and reduced scalability.

Best practice:

Hybrid model — Commands internally, Events externally

Message vs Event in Saga (Final Verdict)
| Use           | Use This          |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Start Saga    | Command / Message |
| Progress Saga | Events            |
| Notify Others | Events            |
| Compensations | Commands          |

| Aspect        | Message-based | Event-based  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Coupling      | High          | Low          |
| Scalability   | Medium        | High         |
| Extensibility | Hard          | Easy         |
| Style         | Orchestration | Choreography |
| Preferred     | ❌             | ✅            |


Step-by-step flow

1. OrderService → OrderCreated EVENT
2. PaymentService → PaymentCompleted EVENT
3. InventoryService → InventoryReserved EVENT
4. ShippingService → ShipmentCreated EVENT

Failure scenario

Inventory fails → InventoryFailed EVENT
→ PaymentService → RefundPayment
→ OrderService → OrderCancelled

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| order-events     | OrderCreated, OrderCancelled       |
| payment-events   | PaymentCompleted, PaymentFailed    |
| inventory-events | InventoryReserved, InventoryFailed |
