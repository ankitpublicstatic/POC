The key differences between **`String`**, **`StringBuilder`**, and **`StringBuffer`** in Java lie in **immutability**, **thread safety**, and **performance**.

Let’s break it down clearly:

---

## 🔹 1. `String` (Immutable)

### ✅ Characteristics:

* **Immutable**: Once created, a `String` object cannot be changed.
* Every time you modify a `String`, **a new object is created**.

### 📌 Example:

```java
String s = "Hello";
s = s + " World"; // creates a new object
```

Here, `"Hello"` and `"Hello World"` are two different objects in memory.

### 🧠 Use When:

* String is not frequently modified.
* Thread safety is not a concern.
* Memory usage is not a bottleneck.

---

## 🔹 2. `StringBuilder` (Mutable, Not Thread-Safe)

### ✅ Characteristics:

* **Mutable**: Can modify the object without creating new ones.
* **Not synchronized**: **Not thread-safe**, but **faster** than `StringBuffer`.

### 📌 Example:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World"); // modifies the same object
System.out.println(sb); // Hello World
```

### 🧠 Use When:

* Performance is important.
* You are working in a **single-threaded environment**.
* You are doing a lot of string concatenation.

---

## 🔹 3. `StringBuffer` (Mutable, Thread-Safe)

### ✅ Characteristics:

* **Mutable**, like `StringBuilder`.
* **Synchronized**: Thread-safe for multithreaded operations.
* Slightly **slower** than `StringBuilder` due to overhead of synchronization.

### 📌 Example:

```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
sb.append(" World"); // thread-safe modification
System.out.println(sb); // Hello World
```

### 🧠 Use When:

* You need **thread safety**.
* You are using strings in **multi-threaded applications**.

## 🔍 Comparison Table:

| Feature         | `String`         | `StringBuilder`     | `StringBuffer`       |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Mutability**  | Immutable        | Mutable             | Mutable              |
| **Thread Safe** | Yes (immutable)  | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (synchronized) |
| **Performance** | Slowest (copies) | Fastest (no sync)   | Slower than Builder  |
| **Use Case**    | Constants, keys  | Single-threaded ops | Multi-threaded ops   |
| **Package**     | `java.lang`      | `java.lang`         | `java.lang`          |

---

## ✅ Summary (When to Use What):

* Use **`String`** when your text does **not change often**.
* Use **`StringBuilder`** when you are doing **lots of modifications** and you are in a **single-threaded environment**.
* Use **`StringBuffer`** when you are in a **multi-threaded** environment and need **safety**.
