## What the interviewers are looking for (key competencies)

Before diving into questions, here are the main qualities/skills they will assess:

| Competency | Why it matters in this context |
|---|---|
| Stakeholder & client management | In a banking environment like BNY Mellon, the Delivery Manager often interfaces with risk, compliance, operations teams. For a client-facing role via Mphasis, you’ll need to manage client expectations, SLAs, escalations. |
| Delivery / execution mindset | They will evaluate how you deliver on time, within budget, manage scope, manage change. |
| Process / governance orientation | Banking has strong regulatory, audit, quality requirements, so processes (change control, risk management, quality assurance) matter. |
| Leadership & team management | You’ll need to lead cross-functional teams (dev, QA, operations) possibly across geographies. |
| Risk, issues & escalation handling | How you foresee, mitigate, and manage risks when things go off plan. |
| Metrics, reporting & KPIs | You must show that you work with measurable metrics (velocity, quality, defect rate, burn-down, SLA compliance). |
| Domain / technical knowledge | Even if not coding, you must understand technology stacks, integration, data, security etc (especially in banking). |
| Behavioral / culture fit | Soft skills, communication, conflict resolution, decision making. |

If you can frame your answers with **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) — that often helps.

## Sample Interview Questions & Suggested Answer Approaches

Below are potential questions you may get, along with how to think about structuring your answers.

### 1. **Tell me about a challenging delivery you led end-to-end. What were the obstacles and how did you overcome them?**

**What they want to see:** End-to-end perspective, dealing with constraints (time, scope, resource), risk mitigation, stakeholder management, result/impact.

**How to answer (structure):**

- **Situation/Task:** Briefly describe the project: domain (banking / payments / etc.), scale, team size, stakeholder complexity.
- **Actions you took:** Focus on your decision-making: how you broke down work, set governance, prioritized, managed risks, escalations, stakeholder communication, change control.
- **Results:** Concrete outcomes: delivered on schedule / how much deviation, cost savings, quality metrics, customer satisfaction, lessons learnt.

> *Example:*  
> “In my previous role, we had to deliver a new reconciliation module for a payments platform within 6 months. Midway, a key external API vendor changed their contract terms, affecting our data interface design (risk). I re-assessed the interface, held immediate workshop with client, proposed a phased cutover (parallel run), reallocated dev resources, and introduced daily stand-ups with the vendor. Despite the change, we delivered in 7 months with only 5% slippage, and client accepted the phased approach without disrupting operations.”

### 2. **How do you handle scope creep from the client side or internal stakeholders?**

**What they want to see:** You can protect delivery commitments, negotiate, manage change requests.

**Good answer directions:**

- Talk about having a formal change control process.
- Emphasize documenting requirements, getting sign-offs.
- Use impact analysis (time, cost, resources) and present options to stakeholders.
- Sometimes negotiate to defer changes to future releases.
- Maintain communication transparency, escalation paths.

> “I always insist that any change request goes through a formal Change Request (CR) process: we document impact in terms of effort, timeline, risk, and present to client / governance board. We then mutually agree: accept as a new release, essential only, or defer. Over time, this discipline reduces uncontrolled additions and ensures delivery stability.”

---

### 3. **How do you manage conflicting priorities between two or more key stakeholders?**

**What they want to see:** Ability to balance, negotiate trade-offs, drive alignment.

**Answer pointers:**

- Show you actively listen to understand motivations.
- Use objective criteria (business impact, ROI, risk) to prioritize.
- Facilitate alignment workshops, conflict resolution.
- Escalate only when required, but try to find consensus.

> “In a previous project, the operations team wanted a feature for better monitoring, while the business team pushed new reporting. I convened a prioritization session, mapped features to business KPIs, showed trade-offs, and got both sides to agree on a minimal viable deliverable first, and schedule the other part later. This maintained goodwill and avoided delivery delay.”

---

### 4. **What metrics / KPIs do you use to track delivery health?**

**What they want to see:** You are data-driven and use meaningful metrics.

**Possible metrics you can mention:**

- Velocity / throughput, sprint burn-down / burn-up  
- Percent committed vs delivered  
- Defect density / severity trend  
- Cycle time, lead time  
- Customer satisfaction / NPS for deliverables  
- SLA compliance, on-time delivery  
- Budget variance, resource utilization

> “In my projects, I track sprint burn-down, velocity trends, defect leakage (post-release), cycle time per ticket, percent on-time deliverables, and stakeholder satisfaction. For example, when I saw our velocity dropping 20%, I delved into root causes (unplanned work, dependencies) and rebalanced backlog, which helped regain performance.”

---

### 5. **How do you identify and handle risks and issues during a project?**

**What they want to see:** Proactive risk management, mitigation, escalation, lessons learnt.

**Structure answer:**

- You maintain a **risk register** (with probability, impact, owner, mitigation plan).
- At regular intervals (weekly, in governance), review top risks.
- For issues, have issue logs, immediate response, corrective plans.
- Escalation mechanism (to client, steering committee) when unresolved.
- Root cause analysis and lessons learnt mechanism post-delivery.

> “For each project I start with risk identification workshops (team + stakeholders), classify and prioritize them. I update the register weekly, highlight new high-impact risks in governance meetings, and assign owners. If an issue becomes blocking, I escalate after defined time frames, ensuring visibility. After project closure, I conduct a lessons-learnt session to feed back into future planning.”

---

### 6. **How would you manage operating in a regulated banking environment (e.g. compliance, audit, security)?**

**What they want to see:** You are aware that in banking, non-functional, compliance, security, audit demands are as important as features.

**Answer touchpoints:**

- Early inclusion of compliance & security requirements in backlog, not as afterthought.
- Engage the audit/compliance function early; get checkpoints (reviews, approvals).
- Incorporate security testing (static code analysis, penetration testing) in development.
- Document everything (traceability, logs, change control) for audit trail.
- Sign-off gates (design review, code review, QA, UAT) must include compliance check.

> “In a banking domain project, we worked with the risk & cyber teams from day 1. We created a compliance backlog, assigned SOD (segregation of duty) controls, had gateways for architecture/security review, and did pen-testing before production. Because audit was involved early, our delivery passed regulatory checks with minimal rework.”

---

### 7. **How do you build, mentor, and manage a geographically distributed team?**

**What they want to see:** Leadership across sites, cultural sensitivity, performance management, communication.

**Answer tips:**

- Establish clear roles, responsibilities, and RACI.
- Use regular touchpoints: daily stand-ups (if Agile), weekly leadership sync, cross-site demos.
- Encourage knowledge sharing, cross-training.
- Use collaboration tools (e.g. Confluence, Teams, Jira) and ensure visibility.
- Be sensitive to cultural/timezone issues.
- Provide feedback & career growth plans; one-on-ones.

> “In one engagement, team was spread across US, India, and Europe. I instituted overlapping working hours, a “bug bash” cross-site every sprint, lunch-and-learn calls, and used rotating mentors so that knowledge wasn’t siloed. I did monthly 1:1s and encouraged open feedback culture. This helped sustain velocity and morale despite distance.”

---

### 8. **If Mphasis is the delivery partner and BNY is your client, how would you manage expectations and communication with both?**

**What they want to see:** Multi-stakeholder management, clarity, transparency, boundary management.

**Answer suggestions:**

- Set clear communication cadences (steering meetings, status updates, risk reviews) with both client and internal (Mphasis) teams.
- Maintain aligned messaging; don’t let the client and internal team have conflicting information.
- Use an escalation matrix (who to involve at what level) and ensure both sides are aware.
- From the start, clarify governance, roles, SLAs, deliverables, sign-offs.
- Act as liaison; negotiate trade-offs and ensure internal team capacity is well understood by client.

> “In such a matrix setup, I would define a joint governance model involving Mphasis and BNY stakeholders up front: regular steering calls, issue/risk escalation levels, sign-off gates. I’d ensure all major decisions are documented and approved jointly. I’d also manage buffer in scheduling, so that internal dependencies don’t become client-facing delays. In case of conflicts, I’d air them early in governance meetings and propose compromises.”

---

### 9. **Tell me about a time when you had to make a tough decision under pressure. How did you take it and what was the outcome?**

**What they want to see:** Courage, decision-making under ambiguity, ownership, accountability.

**Answer structure:**

- Situation & stakes: set up the pressure scenario.
- What options you weighed, how you gathered information quickly.
- What decision you made and why.
- What you did to mitigate risk and how you communicated it.
- Outcome and learning.

> “At one point mid-project, one of our core modules failed integration tests late, and it was likely to delay the release by 2 weeks. I had to choose: either cut that module and release the rest, or delay everything. I consulted the client, presented impact, and proposed releasing the rest first and rolling the module in a patch. We agreed. The release went out with 90% of the features; later the module was patched without disrupting production. The client appreciated the compromise. Learned: always plan fallback options in design stage.”

---

### 10. **Behavioral / soft skills questions you should be ready for**

Some common behavioral or “fit” questions (especially from BNY):

- Tell me about yourself (your career journey, focusing on delivery / leadership).  
- Why do you want to work for BNY Mellon / this particular engagement?  
- Strengths and weaknesses / What is your development area?  
- Describe a conflict in a team and how you resolved it.  
- How do you deal with stress / tight deadlines?  
- Where do you see yourself in 5 years?  
- Do you have experience in financial services / banking domain?  
- Have you managed stakeholder resistance (e.g., from senior leadership) — describe.  
- How do you prioritize your tasks / if all tasks are urgent?  
- What would you do if you realize mid-delivery that you may not meet a committed deadline?  

BNY-specific ones often include scenario questions like “Tell me about a time you faced a compliance or audit issue” or “How do you ensure risk controls in delivery.” citeturn0search27turn0search28  

Also, in BNY interviews, candidates mention general behavioral & challenge-based questions such as:

- “Tell me about a challenge you faced in your previous job that taught you something you didn’t expect.” citeturn0search28  
- “Why would our clients here at Bank of New York Mellon trust you / how would you manage clients?” citeturn0search13turn0search27

## How to Prepare / Tips for This Specific Context

1. **Know BNY Mellon’s domain & operations**  
   – Understand their business (asset servicing, payments, custody, etc.).  
   – Be aware of regulatory, security, audit constraints typical in banking IT.  
   – Speak their language: SLAs, data integrity, reconciliation, failover, business continuity.

2. **Understand the client model (with Mphasis as delivery partner)**  
   – Be ready to explain how you’ll coordinate across client/delivery teams, manage offshore/onshore split, and handle cultural / time zone challenges.  
   – Show experience (or thought process) in managing vendor performance, internal partner teams and external stakeholders.

3. **Prepare real examples (your own experience)**  
   – Use 2–3 strong project stories (preferably from banking / financial services) you can adapt to different questions.  
   – For those stories, pre-think: what problems arose, what actions *you* took, what was the impact, what you learned.

4. **Brush up on delivery / process frameworks**  
   – Agile / Scrum / Kanban, hybrid models  
   – Waterfall for legacy / regulatory domains  
   – Risk management, change control, governance models, RACI  
   – Tools and metrics you used (Jira, Confluence, dashboards, Power BI etc.)

5. **Mock / practice with STAR**  
   – For behavioral and scenario questions, structure your answers cleanly (Situation → Task → Action → Result).  
   – Practice articulating trade-offs and decision-making clarity under pressure.

6. **Ask questions (shows engagement)**  
   Some you can ask your interviewer:  
   - What are the key delivery challenges for this engagement?  
   - What governance structure / escalation mechanisms exist?  
   - How mature is the client in Agile / DevOps / automation?  
   - What is the client’s tolerance for changes / flexibility?  
   - How does success look like in the first 6 months?
