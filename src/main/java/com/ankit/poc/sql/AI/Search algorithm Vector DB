Database / Library	Category	Key Feature / Philosophy	Primary Indexing Technology

Milvus -> Native	 -> Open‑source, highly scalable, focused on MLOps with decoupled storage and compute	Flexible: -> HNSW, IVF, PQ and others

Pinecone -> Native -> 	Managed SaaS service emphasizing ease of use and performance -> HNSW (and related graph‑based ANN)

Weaviate -> 	 Native -> 	Open‑source, GraphQL API, connects vectors in a knowledge‑graph‑style data model -> 	HNSW
Qdrant -> 	Native -> 	Open‑source, Rust‑based, performance‑focused with advanced filtering capabilities -> 	HNSW with custom optimizations
PostgreSQL (pgvector) -> 	Integrated -> 	Keeps structured data and vectors together in the same relational database	 -> IVF‑Flat and HNSW (via pgvector)

Elasticsearch -> 	Integrated -> 	Combines full‑text keyword search with semantic vector search in one engine -> 	HNSW‑style ANN for dense vectors
