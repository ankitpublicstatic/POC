🌍 Top 10 Software Security Standards Under GDPR & Global Compliance

1. Data Minimization

Principle: Collect and process only the data that is necessary for the intended purpose.
Meaning:

Avoid storing unnecessary user data (e.g., personal details not used in processing).
Implement data classification — separate personal, sensitive, and anonymized data.
  Implementation Example:
Don’t collect full date of birth if only age verification is required.
Apply field-level validation to ensure only required data is accepted.

---

2. Encryption (Data-at-Rest and In-Transit)

Principle: Protect personal data from unauthorized access or theft.
Meaning:

Encrypt sensitive data both in storage (AES-256, for example) and during transmission (TLS/HTTPS).
  Implementation Example:
Database encryption using AES.
TLS certificates on APIs and web services.
Use key management solutions like AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault.

---

3. Access Control & Authentication

Principle: Restrict access to personal data based on role and necessity.
Meaning:

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).
Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (multi-factor authentication).
  Implementation Example:
Developers and support staff access production data only through authorized channels.
API keys and tokens stored securely.

---

4. Data Integrity & Audit Trails

Principle: Ensure that personal data is accurate and traceable.
Meaning:

Log who accesses, modifies, or deletes data.
Keep immutable audit trails to demonstrate compliance.
  Implementation Example:
Store audit logs in append-only systems (e.g., Elasticsearch + Filebeat).
Use hash verification (SHA-256) for data integrity validation.

---

5. Data Retention & Erasure

Principle: Retain data only as long as it is needed and delete it securely when no longer required.
Meaning:

Define data retention policies per business function.
Support “Right to be Forgotten” (Article 17 of GDPR).
  Implementation Example:
Automated scripts to delete data after retention period.
Secure deletion tools or overwriting techniques (DoD 5220.22-M).

---

6. Privacy by Design and by Default

Principle: Embed privacy into system architecture and default settings.
Meaning:

Design systems that ensure privacy is the default option.
Minimize user tracking or profiling.
  Implementation Example:
Use pseudonymization or anonymization for analytics.
Disable public sharing by default in user settings.

---

7. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)

Principle: Integrate security in every stage of development.
Meaning:

Apply OWASP Top 10 practices.
Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
  Implementation Example:
Implement code reviews with security focus.
CI/CD pipelines integrate dependency scanning (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk).

---

8. Incident Response & Breach Notification

Principle: Detect, respond, and notify about data breaches in time.
Meaning:

GDPR mandates notification to authorities within 72 hours of breach detection.
  Implementation Example:
Set up automated intrusion detection (IDS/IPS).
Maintain incident response playbooks and communication protocols.

---

9. Third-Party & Vendor Risk Management

Principle: Ensure that external services comply with GDPR and security standards.
Meaning:

Conduct Data Processing Agreements (DPA) with all vendors.
Regularly audit vendor security controls.
  Implementation Example:
Use trusted cloud providers (ISO 27001 or SOC 2 certified).
Maintain vendor assessment checklist.

---

10. User Rights Management & Consent

Principle: Respect user rights for data control, access, and consent.
Meaning:

Users must be able to:

  Access their data (Right of Access)
  Correct inaccuracies (Right to Rectification)
  Delete data (Right to Erasure)
  Withdraw consent anytime
    Implementation Example:
Add a GDPR-compliant consent banner.
Provide APIs/UI for users to download or delete their data.

Would you like me to prepare a visual table (PDF or chart) summarizing these top 10 points for presentation or interview notes? It would make it easy to revise and explain quickly.


Perfect — let’s go deep into OWASP ASVS / OWASP Top 10, which are among the most widely recognized global standards for web application security and are also referenced in GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST for ensuring data protection.  

We’ll break it down as:  
1️⃣ What OWASP ASVS is  
2️⃣ What OWASP Top 10 is  
3️⃣ Then explain each Top 10 vulnerability in depth with prevention techniques.

🔐 1. What is OWASP?

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a non-profit global community focused on improving the security of software.  
It provides free, open-source resources like:
- OWASP Top 10
- OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)
- OWASP Cheat Sheets
- OWASP Testing Guide

---

🧱 2. What is OWASP ASVS?

OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard) defines a framework of security requirements that developers and security teams can use to design, build, and test secure applications.  

It provides 3 Levels of assurance:
- Level 1 – Basic (for all web apps)
- Level 2 – Standard (for apps handling sensitive data)
- Level 3 – Advanced (for critical systems like banking or healthcare)

It’s like a security checklist or benchmark for verifying whether an application is developed securely.

🧨 3. OWASP Top 10 (2021 Update) — Explained in Depth

These represent the 10 most critical security risks to web applications, as identified by OWASP globally.

---

A01: Broken Access Control
What it means:  
Users can access data or functions they shouldn’t be able to.  

Examples:
- Viewing other users’ data via changing the user ID in URL (`/user?id=123` → `/user?id=124`)
- Unauthorized admin access

How to prevent:
- Enforce RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Deny by default → whitelist allowed actions
- Disable client-side access control checks (always validate on the server)

---

A02: Cryptographic Failures *(Previously “Sensitive Data Exposure”)*
What it means:  
Sensitive data (like passwords, credit card numbers) is not encrypted properly.  

Examples:
- Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Storing passwords in plain text
- Weak encryption algorithms (like MD5 or SHA1)

How to prevent:
- Use TLS 1.2+ for transmission
- Store passwords with bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (AES-256)

---

A03: Injection
What it means:  
Untrusted input is sent to an interpreter (like SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, or OS command).  

Examples:
- SQL Injection (`SELECT FROM users WHERE name = 'admin' --`)
- Command Injection (`os.system("rm -rf " + user_input)`)

How to prevent:
- Use prepared statements / parameterized queries
- Validate & sanitize all input
- Avoid concatenating user input into queries

---

A04: Insecure Design
What it means:  
The application design lacks security principles (not just coding mistakes).  

Examples:
- No account lockout mechanism after multiple login attempts
- No input validation rules defined during design

How to prevent:
- Perform threat modeling during design phase
- Use secure design patterns and frameworks
- Define security requirements early in SDLC

---

A05: Security Misconfiguration
What it means:  
Improperly configured servers, frameworks, or apps expose systems.  

Examples:
- Default passwords left unchanged
- Unnecessary services enabled
- Debug mode turned on in production

How to prevent:
- Harden servers and frameworks
- Disable directory listing and error stack traces
- Automate configuration audits with tools like Ansible, Chef, or Terraform

---

A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
What it means:  
Using outdated or insecure software libraries or dependencies.  

Examples:
- Outdated version of Spring or Log4j vulnerable to RCE
- Using libraries with known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

How to prevent:
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot
- Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

---

A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
What it means:  
Poor implementation of authentication mechanisms allows attackers to impersonate users.  

Examples:
- No rate limiting on login
- Weak session management
- Session IDs not invalidated after logout

How to prevent:
- Enforce MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Use secure session cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`)
- Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts

---

A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
What it means:  
Application fails to verify integrity of software updates, plugins, or critical data.  

Examples:
- Using unverified code from GitHub
- Unsigned software updates
- Insecure CI/CD pipelines

How to prevent:
- Digitally sign all updates
- Use integrity checksums (SHA-256)
- Implement security validation in CI/CD pipelines

---

A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
What it means:  
Inadequate logging, monitoring, or alerting of security events.  

Examples:
- No alerts for repeated failed logins
- Logs not monitored for anomalies
- Logs stored in plain text

How to prevent:
- Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk)
- Log security-relevant events (auth, data changes)
- Set up real-time alerts for suspicious activity

---

A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
What it means:  
An attacker tricks the server into making a request to an internal or external system.  

Examples:
- Attacker submits a URL that the backend server fetches (e.g., `/fetch?url=http://internal-service/admin`)
- Exploiting metadata endpoints in cloud services

How to prevent:
- Validate and whitelist allowed URLs
- Disable internal network access from application servers
- Use SSRF protection headers in frameworks or WAFs

---
